Audit Report

Title: Reentrancy Vulnerability in withdraw()

Severity: Critical

Reason:
The contract performs an external call before updating internal state,
allowing a malicious contract to re-enter withdraw() multiple times and
drain funds.

Location:

Contract: VulnerableBankVul
Function: withdraw(uint256 amount)

Vulnerability Description:

The withdraw() function sends ETH to msg.sender using a low-level call
before reducing the user's recorded balance.

Because control is transferred to an external address before the balance
is updated, a malicious contract can execute a fallback() or receive()
function and call withdraw() again.

Since the balance has not yet been reduced, the balance check passes
repeatedly, allowing multiple withdrawals within the same transaction.

Impact:

An attacker can drain ETH from the contract beyond their legitimate balance.

Potential consequences include:

- theft of all ETH stored in the contract
- loss of user funds
- protocol insolvency
- complete contract compromise

Proof of Concept:
        1. Deploy VulnerableBankVul.
        2. User deposits ETH into the bank.
        3. Attacker deposits a small amount of ETH.
        4. Attacker calls withdraw().
        5. During the external call:

        msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");

        6. Attacker's fallback/receive function executes.
        7. Fallback calls withdraw() again.
        8. Balance check still succeeds because balance has not been reduced.
        9. Process repeats until contract funds are drained.

Root Cause:
The contract violates the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern.

Vulnerable code:
require(balance[msg.sender] >= amount, "Not enough balance");
(bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
require(success, "Transfer failed");
balance[msg.sender] -= amount;
State update occurs after the external interaction.

Recommendation:

Follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern:
1. Check requirements
2. Update state
3. Perform external interaction

Additionally consider using a reentrancy guard.

Example:

balance[msg.sender] -= amount;
(bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
require(success, "Transfer failed");
